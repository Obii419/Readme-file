I feel very ready and confident to take the next step in my career path as a programmer. This Bootcamp has been a great foundation for me, helping me build both the knowledge and confidence needed to move forward in the tech industry.

One of the biggest highlights for me has been the wide range of skills I’ve gained. I learned frontend development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and also explored backend programming with Python and working with APIs. Before this Bootcamp, I had no idea about most of these technologies, but now I can comfortably build full web applications from scratch.

Overall, this experience has opened up so many opportunities for me. I’m excited to continue growing and to apply what I’ve learned in real-world projects and professional environments.
